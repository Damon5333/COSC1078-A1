<h1>Interest in IT</h1>

<p>1.I am interested in IT because IT is like a magical tool that allows me to communicate with my computer through code. Another important reason is that society is now more and more dependent on the Internet, so learning IT is very helpful for my future personal employment. I started to be interested in IT when I first started to contact the Internet, so I decided to start learning IT at college and be able to help others through the knowledge I learned.</p>
<p>2.The reason why I chose to study IT at RMIT is very important. It is also a point that RMIT is different from other schools. RMIT is a very practical school. Most other schools may be more theoretical, but IT. It takes a lot of practice to master, so RMIT is definitely a good school to learn IT.</p>
<p>3.During my studies at RMIT, I hope to learn computer languages such as JAVA, C+. These languages can help me write my own programs in the future. A good program can usually facilitate people's lives. If I make the program later, Being able to help people, the years of studying at RMIT will be a significant time in my life.</p>

<h1>Project ideas</h1>
<h3>Overview</h3>
<p>The project I want to develop is a multi-language translation application.The application has integrated professional dictionary in Chinese, English, Japanese, Korean and French. By switching the language environment, you can quickly translate the required content. The web version has a translation and supports Chinese, English, Japanese, Korean, French, Spanish and Russian. Translating in seven languages, and when you say a word, the app can automatically recognize and convert to the language you want to translate.</p>
<h3>Motivation</h3>
<p>According to statistics, in 2000, a total of 600,000 people from China went abroad to study abroad. This is the first time that more than 600,000 students have studied abroad. This shows that the number of students studying abroad is increasing every year, so a good translation application can solve many people's language barriers. One thing different from other translation tools is that my project will be equipped with artificial intelligence, which is more convenient. Just like Siri, it can help users solve some small problems and bring a better experience to users.</P>
<h3>Description</h3>
<p>The main users of this project can be divided into two large groups, one group is a student and the other group is a working group abroad. Students can also be divided into two parts, foreign students and students in China, major users or international students, foreign students will be exposed to more different languages, especially those who have just studied abroad, have a weak language foundation, and cannot understand the basic language well. This software can help them learn. For example, when they are in class, they open the application and start the voice translation function. The words spoken by the teacher can be translated into the language they understand, or the words spoken by the teacher can be saved in the mobile phone. Or on the computer, so that they can review the contents of the class at home. </P>
<p>The other part of the population is the one who has graduated from work abroad. Those who have graduated must have a very good English foundation, but this does not mean that they can respond smoothly to various language problems at work. Different jobs have Different terminology, these terms are not commonly understood by graduates, so when they don't understand the various industry terminology, they open the application and start the terminology translation function, so they can continue to work smoothly, without being unfamiliar. The troubles of words, of course, this feature also supports speech translation.</p>
<p>I want to develop this project in order to go beyond all other translation software, without any shortcomings, but nothing is perfect. I can now think of a serious problem if this software is developed and widely used. That is, people will rely too much on this translation software, because it is too powerful, so that people completely give up the ability and opportunity to learn the language autonomously. I still can't think of any solution to this problem, but in the future, I might set a limit so that people don't rely too much. Because the purpose of developing this project is to help people solve problems in study or work. If the cart before the horse is turned upside down, then the software has no value.</P>
<h3>Tools and Technologies</h3>
<p>I don't know much about the tools and technologies that need to develop this software. Because I mentioned it before, I don't know much about the IT discipline, so I don't know what technology and tools to use. In the future study, I will learn and learn for this goal.</p>
<h3>Skills Required (100 words) </h3>
<P>Same as last paragraph</p>
<h3>Outcome</h3>
<p>If this software is really developed and widely used in the future, and people are not too dependent, but use it correctly. Then the invention of this project will solve most of the problems of people's study and work, and even close the distance between the country and the country, making it easier for people from different countries to communicate and communicate. It can be said that it is a tool make the world closer. It can even play a major role in peace throughout the world.</p>
